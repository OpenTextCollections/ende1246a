01,1,Baet bo llan a allame de tubutubu gogon — How Cuscus got his short ears,"Baet bo llan a allame de tubutubu gogon is a narrative archived in Lindsey (2015b) and can be cited as Kidarga (2016: WE_PN001). It was submitted to the collection in written form by Minong Kidarga of Limol village in 2016 to be included in a book for the Limol Elementary School. It was edited by W. Kurupel, T. Warama, and K. Lindsey. Editing involved rewriting the text with a standardized orthog- raphy and light editing to word choice, word order, or style. After editing, K. Lindsey recorded T. Warama reading the text aloud and later retelling the story from memory using a Zoom H4 recorder and head-mounted microphone. These recordings are archived in the collection as Warama (2016d) and Warama (2016e), respectively. W. Kurupel, T. Warama, K. Lindsey, and other members of the Ende Language Committee transcribed these recordings and translated all three texts at the phrase level. After this, K. Lindsey imported the texts into the Ende FLEx database and translated them at the morpheme level with help from C. Scanlon and various Ende Language Committee members. The illustrations accompanying the story in Section A.3 were drawn by Kiplin Geoff for inclusion in the book titled Pepeb Peba (Folk Stories) assembled by John- son et al. (2016b).",Kidarga,"Kidarga. 2025. Baet bo llan a allame de tubutubu gogon -- How Cuscus got his short ears. In Lindsey, Kate L.

02,2,Kottllam bo pallall ttoenttoen — Turtle’s story,"Kottllam bo pallall ttoenttoen ‘Turtle’s story’ is a pourquoi story told by Tonny (Tonzah) Warama for inclusion in a compilation of children’s stories for the Limol Elementary School called Pepeb Peba (Folk Stories) (Johnson et al. 2016a). T. Warama first told the story to D. Johnson on October 9, 2016 (4.6 minutes; Warama 2016f), retold it to K. Lindsey on October 29, 2016 (7.3 minutes; Warama 2016h), helped us write it down for Pepeb Peba (Warama 2016g), and then read that version aloud later that day (Warama 2016i). All four texts were transcribed, translated, and put into the Ende FLEx corpus, where they were further trans- lated at the word and morpheme level by K. Lindsey, with the help of C. Scanlon, W. Kurupel, and T. Warama. The written version (Warama 2016g) is printed be- low with the original illustrations by A. Kaoga (Dobola) from the Pepeb Peba book.",Tonny Warama,"Tonny Warama. 2025.

03,3,Kakayam bo tongoe — The Bird of Paradise Song,"The Bird of Paradise song and dance was written by Sali Goge (Wik) to be per- formed by the Malam Culture and Dance Group (see Figure 1.44). When the Bird of Paradise song is performed, the dancers wear grass skirts, cassowary feather armbands, legbands, and headdresses, and carry abor, a tool used to pound sago (see Figure C.1). The dancers sing and are accompanied by the kundu drum (played by the decorated man in the foreground of Figure C.1). The choreogra- phy for this song emulates the movements of the bird of paradise with flapping elbows, jumps, and turns. The lyrics repeat the lines ‘The Bird-of-Paradise is singing in the garden of Eden. The people, we see how he plays. Kwa-o, kwa- o, ke-ke-ke.’ Here, the surroundings of the Ende villages are compared to the Garden of Eden from Christian mythology. This type of comparison is common among Ende-based Christian rhetoric, where the stories in the Bible have direct equivalence to local places, customs, and even ancestry. The Bird-of-Paradise has a special cultural importance in Ende culture and in Papua New Guinea. The Bird-of-Paradise is the national bird of Papua New Guinea and the totem of many local clan groups. The Bird-of-Paradise is renowned for its long tail feathers and elaborate dances. The song, dance, and story behind the song can be heard and viewed in the Ende language corpus (Goge (Wik) 2015, 2016a,b,c,d).",Sali Goge,"Sali Goge. 2025.

08,8,Käza misima saima — The Crocodile Song,"Käza misima saima is an ancient song for the Tizag (Bobeag) clan, which has the käza ‘crocodile’ as their primary totem. When a crocodile has been killed, the hunters sing this song to let the Tizag clan know that one of their totem animals has been slain. Traditionally, a gift was also offered to the elders of the clan, out of respect for the loss of their totem.
